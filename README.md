# NotAVirus
(Just kidding, it's a virus.)

NOTE: THIS VIRUS IS ACTUALLY DANGEROUS AND CRASHES MOST COMPUTERS IN SECONDS. (Not pcs though.) DO NOT USE THIS. ONE OF OUR TESTERS HAD ALL THEIR BROWSING DATA - HISTORY, BOOKMARKS, etc. - COMPLETELY DELETED. (Or do, i'm not your boss.)

This is a virus. It goes by many names: Not a virus, TOTALLY not a virus, and 𝙏𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚 𝙬𝙖𝙨 𝙣𝙚𝙫𝙚𝙧 𝙖 𝙘𝙝𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙨𝙪𝙧𝙫𝙞𝙫𝙖𝙡. Install it at your own risk to break your computer, or at least crash your browser. Even firefox was broken in seconds. Have fun!
